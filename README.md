# 🧠 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using EasyOCR

## 📘 Overview

This mini-project demonstrates **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** — a computer vision technique that extracts readable text from images.
Using the **EasyOCR** library (powered by **PyTorch**), this project detects and recognizes characters from various image types such as screenshots, scanned pages, and signboards.

The goal is to automate text extraction from images using a deep learning–based OCR engine.

---

## 🧩 Features

* Reads and extracts printed or handwritten text from images.
* Works efficiently on both **CPU** and **GPU**.
* Supports **multiple languages** (default: English).
* Uses **OpenCV** for image handling and **Matplotlib** for visualization.
* Simple and easy-to-run implementation in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Open the notebook** in Jupyter or Google Colab:

   ```
   Optical_Character_Recognition.ipynb
   ```

2. **Set the image path**:

   ```python
   image_path = '/content/sample_data/image.jpg'
   ```

3. **Run the OCR model**:

   ```python
   import easyocr
   reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'])
   results = reader.readtext(image_path)
   ```

4. **Display recognized text**:

   ```python
   for detection in results:
       text = detection[1]
       print("Detected text:", text)
   ```

5. **Visualize results**:

   ```python
   import cv2, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   img = cv2.imread(image_path)
   plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
   plt.axis('off')
   plt.show()
   ```
